# India AgriMetrics Analysis
## Project Overview

The India Agrimetrics Dashboard is designed to provide insights into agricultural production in India by analyzing crop production metrics, soil conditions, and state-wise crop distribution. The dashboard enables policymakers, researchers, and farmers to optimize agricultural productivity through data-driven decision-making.
### Tools used:
- Excel for data exploration and manipulation
- Power BI for visualization

## Visuals and Their Representation

1. Average pH and Sum of Production by Crop Type - A line graph showing the correlation between soil pH levels and crop production across different crop types.

2. Sum of Production (in tons) by Crop Type - A pie chart illustrating the proportion of total production contributed by different crop types (Rabi, Kharif, Annuals, and Summer crops).

3. Count of Crop by State Name - A bar chart displaying the number of recorded crops across different Indian states.

4. Sum of Production (in tons) by State Name - A horizontal bar chart indicating the total crop production across various states, highlighting the leading and lagging states.

## Source of Data

The data used in this dashboard is sourced from Kaggle, which provides agricultural statistics and research datasets related to Indian crop production. The dataset includes information on crop types, production volumes, soil pH levels, and state-wise agricultural data.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. How does soil pH impact agricultural production across different crop types?

2. What is the distribution of total crop production among different crop types?

3. Which states lead in agricultural production, and which states have lower yields?

4. What patterns can be observed in state-wise crop diversity?

5. What recommendations can be made to enhance agricultural productivity in India?

## Key Insights

1. Declining soil pH levels negatively impact crop production.

3. Uttar Pradesh (12,600) and Madhya Pradesh (9,300) lead in crop diversity, whereas Goa (100) has the lowest recorded crop count, highlighting climate-driven diversity.

5. Rabi (44.2%) and Kharif (38.81%) crops dominate agricultural production, while Summer crops (2.9%) are limited by heat and water scarcity.

7. Uttar Pradesh is the top producer with 0.70 billion tons, followed by West Bengal (0.44 billion tons). Chandigarh records the lowest production at 63 tons.

## Recommendations

1. Soil Optimization: Improving soil pH levels can enhance yields in crops that underperform due to acidic or alkaline soil conditions.

2. Crop Suitability Research: Identifying suitable crops for each state based on soil and climatic conditions can optimize production.

3. Climate-Smart Agriculture: Encouraging sustainable farming methods and crop diversification can help mitigate regional climatic variations.

4. Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating collaboration between high- and low-producing states to implement best agricultural practices and maximize output.
